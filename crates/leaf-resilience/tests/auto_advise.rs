//! THE leaf-resilience AUTO-ADVISE PROOF-GATE: REAL annotated beans whose
//! `#[advisable]` services are AUTO-ADVISED end-to-end through
//! `Application::new().run()` — proving the TWO Infrastructure resilience advisors
//! leaf-resilience ships AUTO-WIRE:
//!
//! 1. a RETRY-advised method that FAILS TWICE then SUCCEEDS is re-invoked up to the
//!    policy (three attempts, the third wins) — the substrate's REPLAYABLE `Next`;
//! 2. a CONCURRENCY-LIMIT-advised method caps concurrent entries to the gate's
//!    limit (no more than N bodies hold a permit at once).
//!
//! What is user code (the NATURAL `#[retryable]` / `#[concurrency_limit]` annotations
//! — NO `#[aspect]`, NO hand-written `ADVISOR_PAIRINGS` rows):
//! - a `register_component!` `LimitGate` — a `ConcurrencyGate` bean wrapping
//!   leaf-tokio's limit-2 `TokioExecutionFacility` (a local newtype: the orphan rule
//!   forbids `#[component]`-ing the foreign type; `register_component!` constructs it
//!   via `::new()`, NOT field-injection);
//! - two `register_component!` + `#[advisable]` services with OWNED atomic state
//!   whose methods carry `#[retryable(max = 3)]` / `#[concurrency_limit(2, gate = ..)]`
//!   (the ADVISED beans).
//!
//! Each natural annotation on a `#[advisable]`-impl method is what the impl-block macro
//! lowers to the const `ADVISOR_PAIRINGS` row (the resilience advisors keyed by the
//! bean's `TypeId`, `#[retryable]` binding the `Result<i64,_>` retry classifier and
//! `#[concurrency_limit]` binding the named gate) — so `Application::run` AUTO-COLLECTS
//! the resilience advisors with NO `.with_advisors`.
